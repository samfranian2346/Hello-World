Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad area of computer applications characterized by the use of symbolic rather than numeric computations. 
Symbolic computation means that symbols, consisting of names rather than numbers, are manipulated. 
Also, symbolic computation is more conveniently done with linked lists of data rather than arrays. This kind of programming sometimes requires more flexibility than other programming domains. 
For example, in some AI applications the ability to create and execute code segments during execution is convenient.
